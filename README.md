Simple university project for Algorithms and Data Structures class.

This is a very simple app that runs on cmd and allows the user to create various artworks, artists and auctions. Then the user can place bids and purchase the paintings having them registered to their "account". The paper with all the details on how the project is meant to work is attached to the program

With this program we learned alot about data structures in Java and how to analyze the efficiency of a program using Big O Notation. Many of the methods of our data structures were written by us, to force us into understaing whats really going on inside our program.
